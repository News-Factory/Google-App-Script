# Google-App-Script

08/03

This is the first iteration of the Google App Script code copied to GitHub.
To work with the App Script editor the project needs 3 things:

1) node.js to be installed on your machine and started in the VS Code terminal (ctrl + shift + `) running npm init
2) the script ID for the project we are working on (found in the App Script Online editor under Project Settings)
3) --clasp-- to be installed in VS Code (video tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwxiEB-Mnys&ab_channel=Get__itDone%21)

To copy a "repository" from the online editor to VS Code use: clasp clone "projectID",

to push changes once into the online editor use:  clasp push,

to have VS Code push changes every time you save a file use:  clasp push -w  and ctrl + c to get out

That's all folks!!!
